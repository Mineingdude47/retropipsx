# RetroPie-Extra

This is a **collection of unofficial installation scripts for RetroPie** allowing you to quickly and easily **install emulators, ports and libretrocores** that haven't been included in RetroPie for one reason or another. These scripts can be considered experimental at best. 
I have found new scripts made by other people and added them to this Repo. I dont take credit for any of them, other then the ones I made

Most of the scripts do work as is. 

**UPDATE**
**YOU WILL NEED TO UPDATE RETROPIE**

**Starting 1-3-25 RetroPie version 4.8.9 or higher is needed**

This needed since the RetroPie helpers that will now being used will not work on older versions of RetroPie

And no I will not be working on ways to make it work with all versions, Please dont ask and if issues are opened and you are using a old version. They will just be closed

**The Pi5 is still being worked on and will continue to grow as time goes on as 64bit is still new for the Pi**

I have changed the list below to show what has been tested to at least to install. I dont have all the games so I cant test them all 

Pull requests and issue reports are accepted and encouraged as well as requests. Feel free to use the issue tracker to send me any personal requests for new scripts that you may have.

**I DONT HAVE A X86, SO I DIDNT TEST THOSE SCRIPTS, YOUR ARE ON YOUR OWN**

## Installation with GUI menu, 
There is a command line way of using this script, instructions coming soon

The following commands will clone the repo to your system and then run the GUI installer where you may select which of the scriptmodules will be copied into the `RetroPie-Setup` folder.

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Exarkuniv/RetroPie-Extra.git
cd RetroPie-Extra/
./install-extras.sh
```

## Command line way of install

```bash

    ./install-extras.sh [-u|--update] [option] [rp_setup_directory]

Options:
    -a  --all       Add all RetroPie-Extra modules (may severely impact the
                    loading time of RetroPie-Setup and retropiemenu configuration
                    items, especially on slower hardware)
    -r  --remove    Remove all RetroPie-Extra modules (does not "uninstall" the modules
                    in RP-Setup)
    -h  --help      Display this help and exit
```

The installation script assumes that RetroPie-Setup is installed to `$HOME/RetroPie-Setup`. You may specify an alternate location on command-line, ex:
    ./install-extras.sh /games/rp-setup
    
## Usage

After installing **RetroPie-Extra**, the extra scripts will be installed directly in the **RetroPie Setup script** (generally in the experimental section), which you can run from either the command line or from the menu within Emulation Station.
```bash
cd ~
cd RetroPie-Setup/
sudo ./retropie_setup.sh
```

## Updating

The following commands will update RetroPie-Extra to the latest repo and then re-run the installer (your installed scripts will be pre-selected. Just install them again to receive the latest updates.)

```bash
cd ~
cd RetroPie-Extra/
./update-extras.sh
```
## OR
```
cd ~/RetroPie-Extra
git pull origin
```
## Remove

The following commands will remove RetroPie-Extra from your system.

```bash
cd ~
cd RetroPie-Extra/
./remove-extras.sh
```

## Change from the old ZeroJay's repo
If you need to update from ZeroJay's repo - first, discard the most recent commit:
```
git reset --hard HEAD^
```
Switch to ExarKuniv's new repo:
```
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Exarkuniv/RetroPie-Extra
```
Then pull again from the updated origin:
```
git pull origin
```

Scripts that are unfinished/untested/unpolished/or broken will not be located in this repository and instead have been moved to [RetroPie-Extra-unstable](https://github.com/Exarkuniv/RetroPie-Extra-unstable).

If there is a [X] that means it Installs and Plays. 

If there is a [4], [5] that ties to that Pi model only
